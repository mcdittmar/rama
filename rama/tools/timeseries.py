class TimeSeries:
    """
    TimeSeries class
       Supports prototype efforts to represent Time Series as a specialized Cube.

    Description:
       Structurally matches the CubePoint Adapter class but..
         o time axis is explicit, as the independent axis of the cube
         o all other axes are dependent. 

       Time axis is expected to be an instance of the TimeAxis class, 
       which is defined in the Cube Adapter

    Note:
       This implementation focuses on the Data segment of the Cube.
       All metadata information associated with the Cube is lost.


    Exceptions:
        AttributeError  - No independent time axis is found
